Exploring individualized health outcomes in schizophrenic patients in Shiny web application.

Final group project for class entitled "Data Visualization for Individualized Health". Worked with two other group members to develop regression model that would predict PANSS scores (severity of symptoms of schizophrenia) over the course of 8 weeks based on individualized medical information. The regression model became the core of the larger project - the Shiny web application. The application allows users to explore the data used in the model, and then apply it to find their own treatment outcomes. 

The web application can be viewed at https://quanbui.shinyapps.io/mental-health-final/
